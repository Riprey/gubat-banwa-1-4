A technick perfected by Sword Poet Sialo Baguna I, a King who spurned rulership to travel with a troupe of professional singers. This requires a quick wit and an even quicker tongue: you perform a poem so quickly that your sword swings are bolstered to follow the rhythm, so fast that it creates a physical barrier of strikes.</em></p>",
