You can spend 1 Beat to meditate and gain <strong>1 Gahom.</strong></p><p><strong>While you have 3+ Gahom, your Thunderbolt Body overwhelms you:</strong> start <strong>Floating</strong> and all your area attacks become <strong>Overwhelming</strong> and <strong>Skewering.</strong></p><p><strong>If you ever gain 6 Gahom, your spiritual power overwhelms you and bursts from you:</strong> you gain 1 <strong>Wound</strong> and lose all HP, then inflict <strong>3 True Hits to all enemies in burst 5.</strong></p>",
