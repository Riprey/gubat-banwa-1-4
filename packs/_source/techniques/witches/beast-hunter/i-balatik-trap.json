When a fighter moves into the line, you can trigger the arbalest to immediately inflict <strong>1 True Hit</strong> and impale the target to the ground. They cannot move voluntarily while impaled. Whenever they are forcibly moved they lose 1 HP. They must spend 1 Beat to remove the arbalest's spike.</p>",
