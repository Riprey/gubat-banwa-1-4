Anything that happens to the target's soul is considered as happening to the original owner of the soul (they can only suffer effects from attacks and techniques once, an area attack cannot affect them twice).</p><p>The owner must move through their soul's tile to stop this effect. All attacks against the soul is <strong>overwhelming</strong> and <strong>skewering.</strong></p><p><strong>Eye of God Fist:</strong> Spend 2 Beats. The target becomes <strong>unable to move voluntarily</strong> until the end of their next riff.</p>",
