The Datu defended his island when he and that warband, forever remembered as the Unexalted, beseeched the diwata of their island: a Serpent God named Maharaya, the Great Streaking Galaxy, to let them keep fighting. The Unexalted were granted this: instead of ascending to the Sky, their souls instead became Umalagad that protected their island even in death. And so Ancient Medang was not able to conquer their island, and to this day the Unexalted still protect it.</em></p>",
