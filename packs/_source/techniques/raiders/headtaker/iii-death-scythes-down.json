When you attack the target, you may add the Death Die, dealing <strong>2 Hits on 8+,</strong> then discard it. If the mark goes away without you attacking, roll the Death Die anyway. You may teleport <strong>1 + Death Die roll.</strong> The Death Die is discarded afterwards.</p><p><strong>Death Sunders Enlightenment:</strong> Spend 3 Beats. The mark lasts for the rest of violence instead, and the Death Die is not discarded when you roll it.</p>",
