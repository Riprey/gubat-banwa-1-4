While in this stance, when you're attacked by a melee attack, change the target to another fighter in range 3, or back at the attacker. The new target may defend against it as normal. Lose the Stance.</p><p><strong>Dancing Furious Mad:</strong> Spend 2 Beats. You can now use this against ranged and area attacks, though redirecting an area attack simply redirects yours and does not affect the other targets of the attack.</p><p><strong>Avalokitesvara's Thousand Hands:</strong> Spend 3 Beats. You now no longer need to lose the stance to redirect attacks, though you can only use it 1/riff, and the redirected attack rolls half the dice. Then, Fly 1.</p>",
