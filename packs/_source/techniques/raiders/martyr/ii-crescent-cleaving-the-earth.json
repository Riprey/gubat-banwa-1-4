Any enemy in the line suffers <strong>1 True Hit.</strong> You cannot use this technique if your weapon is still out in the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Rebounding Crescent:</strong> Spend 2 Beats. Your weapon now <strong>bounces</strong> after the first attack, dealing 1 Hit against a different fighter in range 4 of the first target. Repeat this one more time if possible. The weapon lands on a tile adjacent to the last target. While your weapon is out, your melee attacks gain <strong>Overwhelming,</strong> but your weapon returns to you immediately at the start of your next riff.</p>",
