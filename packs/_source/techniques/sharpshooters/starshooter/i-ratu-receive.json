When an ally targets you or an enemy's ranged attack goes through your tile, end the stance to catch the attack and launch it at any other fighter in the attack's range.</p><p><strong>Rahu Rebuff:</strong> Spend 2 Beats. The caught attack gains +2 attack dice and you may <strong>fly 2</strong> before releasing it.</p><p><strong>Kedu Catches The Moon:</strong> Spend 3 Beats. You gain <strong>+2 Speed and Jump</strong> while in the Stance, and you can now catch up to <strong>2 attacks,</strong> which you keep until the end of your next riff. You launch the attacks when you lose them, and you lose your stance only then.</p>",
