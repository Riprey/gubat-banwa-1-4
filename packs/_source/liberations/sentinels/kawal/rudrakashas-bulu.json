If they do, they suffer <strong>1 True Hit.</strong> You similarly suffer -3d to all attacks that don't include your bulu partner as a target. You and your bulu partner become <strong>immune</strong> to taunts not from each other and neither of you can be <strong>forcibly moved</strong> by other warriors.</p>",
