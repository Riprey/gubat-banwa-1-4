This is exemplified in the beginning of time, where all of existence was nothing but Sky and Sea, both devoid of color or light, an endless undulation, a chaotic dialogue of winds and waves. The Sky and Sea were not separate but part of the same whole, that is the Chaos, the First Cause-Effect. Thus is the importance of learning the Cutting Art of the Sword: the Sword exemplifies that anything that is 2 was once 1, simply cut in twain.</em></p>",
