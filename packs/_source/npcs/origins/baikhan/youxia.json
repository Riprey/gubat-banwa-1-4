    "description": "<p>The Empire long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. The Hegemony of Baik Hu, under the great Vermilion Phoenix, of the Zhu Dynasty, faces upheaval. Many treat the Empress as weak, and they believe that they have lost the Mandate of Heaven. The Empire has begun to fracture: warlords have arisen. There are three major warlords, kings on their own, waiting for their chance to unite Baik Hu under their own sword and banner. How will all things under heaven react to the incoming end of times? The peasants rise, the warlords bring their weapon down. The Empire must divide. The Youxia are wandering warriors that constitute the best swordsmen of Baik Hu.</p><p>(The stats provided here is for a Rank 1 encounter with 4 Kadungganan. Check the book for higher ranks.)</p>",
