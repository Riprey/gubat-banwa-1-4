I am turned monster, sailing across the stars. Is this what thou wisheth upon thine flock? Hast thou forgotten me? Has thou... FORSAKEN ME? I hath been of utmost faith, I hath worked most tirelessly, to accomplish the mission of the Church! I am nothing without thee. Thou hast made me NOTHING WITHOUT THEE. HOW CANST THOU FORSAKE ME, THOU MOST OBEDIENT SERVANT?</p><p>O, Holy Lance of Starlight, thou hast been by my side all this time. Come and let us bring upon ruin upon the heathens. Perhaps, once the great Church and Hellstar has scourged all of Gubat Banwa, canst mine own calvary end. Maybe then I can rest. I fear I will never find rest. The great Star hath work for me even in death. It is my work that matters to them. It is my function. 'Tis the only Nirvana.\"</p><p>(The stats provided here is for a Rank 1 encounter.
