    "description": "<p>Ashra are the great enemies of the Dewa, the Gods. The Anti-Gods: their natures are proud and haughty, do not perform proper sacrifices, reject the Noble Truths, violate sacred laws and spiritual places, break silences, and torture living beings with overwhelmingly excessive violences. It is once said that the ancient empress Tunggadewi, Consort of the Gods, went about and expunged ashra from Gubat Banwa. Now, however, they reincarnate, heralding the end.</p><p>(The stats provided here is for a Rank 1 encounter with 4 Kadungganan. Check the book for higher ranks.)</p>",
