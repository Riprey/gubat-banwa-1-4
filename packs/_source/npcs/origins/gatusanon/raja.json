    "description": "<p><strong>Chief.</strong> True Kings are rare in the Sword Isles. They take upon themselves the title of Raja, but taking upon the name does not make one what is named. To shine with righteousness, to break infinities, to offer Devotion that scorches the sky. That is what a Raja must be, and only those true Raja will survive the grueling Final Festival.</p><p>One such example is <strong>Sri Raja Kus-gan Lokapala:</strong> one of the burgeoning warrior-braves that has collected a formidable force. His banwa, now known as a Kota (City-Fortress), Kota Binarani, has grown in size and has managed to accrue power and resources from the Sultanate of Akai as well as the kingdoms of Rajakami. His current regnal title means \"Lord King Mighty Guardian of the World.\" He seeks to overthrow the Ponong Raja, but he does not seek to rule Gatusan. He seeks to light the flame of enlightenment: he is on the Bodhisattva Path, and he wishes to bring all others with him to true liberation</p><p>(The stats provided here is for a Rank 1 encounter with 4 Kadungganan. Check the book for higher ranks.)</p>",
