    "description": "<p><strong>Chief.</strong> The vicars of the Ashen Star are master martial artists as they have been taught by the angels of war. Virbanweño villages are very commonly made around a single chapel, where the vicar lives. The vicar has the double duty as the spiritual leader and chiefly leader of Virbanweño villages. Many vicars are powerful entities that can defeat demons: things they have been taught. Ashen vicars are masters of Issohappan styles of martial arts that focuses on expunging demons and gods.</p><p>While they have good intentions, and truly might not even want to use their martial prowess, they are commonly pushed to fend off raiders and demons. Vicars are of course, filled with steel conviction, and are the closest thing to bodhisattvas. Commonly vicars are saints that have become reincarnated. Once they remember their past life, they peer past the pall of reality.</p><p>(The stats provided here is for a Rank 1 encounter with 4 Kadungganan. Check the book for higher ranks.)</p>",

When they gain 5 Poise Tokens, they become Poise Broken: they can suffer all Status Effects, can be forcibly moved as normal, and cannot gain any more Poise Tokens. While Poise Broken, a Chief loses 1 Poise Token whenever they start their riff. When they lose all Poise Tokens, they lose Poise Broken and can again gain Poise Tokens."
