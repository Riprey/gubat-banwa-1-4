    "description": "<p><strong>Chief.</strong> A guardian deity that protects the Dharma. Worshipped and channeled when having to fend off injustices and horrors. They are commonly other demons or ashras that have been tamed by monks and buddhas. The first Dharmapala is the monk Sri Kera Jadara, the First Militant Shaman-Monk who traveled the Sword Isles to bind a thousand thousand demons to servitude to the buddha. This is the greatest treasure: eight of them were Demon-Kings, the most powerful of Dharmapala. After his death, the monk rejected Parinirvana and chose to become the vajra, bell, sword, and trident that many dharmapala are allowed to wield.</p><p>(The stats provided here is for a Rank 1 encounter with 4 Kadungganan. Check the book for higher ranks.)</p>",
