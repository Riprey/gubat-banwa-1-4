    "description": "<blockquote><p>Emblazoned Chevaliers of the Throne, Guardians of Nature and Stewards of the Divine Wilds.</p></blockquote><p>Faithful and skilled cavaliers that fight both on land and in the air, as needed, Upon their faithful sarimanok, holy mounts of religious importance. Trained as elite cavalry, only the richest of Datu can outfit and train an entire unit of Sarimanok Knights, much less address the cost of maintaining Sarimanok.</p><p>Sarimanok are holy winged mounts and representatives of Goddess. Legends say Jaris Akai met Sikhandag thanks to a sarimanok that she rode upon, which glinted with the rainbow halo of the full moon. Sometimes this story is said to be the truth of the mythical tale of Raja Indarapatra and Bayi Bulan, which means that Jaris Akai is commonly seen—among those that practice syncretized anitu-annuvara—as an Avatar of the Triumphant God Balahala Saiwa. Sarimanok exemplify the Divine Striving to protect and engage in war to preserve.</p><p>Sarimanok have been there since the beginning of time, some say. They have been there ever since there has been the Rainbow, the sign of victory, born from the tears of the Sky to the Sea, Their love forbidden forever. The sarimanok are large, usually seven to eight foot tall roosters with rainbow feathers that glisten in the sun and sheen in the rain. Their large wingspans allow for limited flight, and their natural hard skin is enough to deter any assailant.</p><p>While Sarimanok Knights were born in Akai, trained from the local warriors here who already rode upon Sarimanok when they unleashed their raids, Virbanwa has also taken to breeding these rainbow raptors to create a sarimanok cavalry of their own. However, theirs are smaller than the colorful plumage and gigantic wings of the sarimanok of the Kalanawan region.</p><p>Sarimanok Knights learn to use longer weapons, larger swords or sibat. They generally wear heavier armor to protect themselves since they don't need overly quick movement. However, they are more or less stuck to their sarimanok in combat. Sarimanok, while not bred for combat, are willing to brave the heat of the skirmish to bring their knight to victory.</p><p>The most skilled of sarimanok knights are run through with the holy ancient lightning bolt of Galura, an aspect of Jamiyun Kulisa (some say mount, others say they have no correlation at all), which bolsters their abilities.</p><blockquote><p>If you choose to become a Sarimanok Knight, ask yourself when you started training, and for what reason? To protect your datu? To save yourself? Your family? Why would you bring a majestic creature into the heat of a skirmish, of a tactical engagement, where both of you are poised to die?</p></blockquote><p><strong>Weapons:</strong> Halberd, pikes, lance, spears, kampilan, bolo, pira, janap</p><p><strong>Armors:</strong> Headwrap, cuirass, tassets, pants, metal boots, peaked helmets, elephant hide breastplate</p>",
