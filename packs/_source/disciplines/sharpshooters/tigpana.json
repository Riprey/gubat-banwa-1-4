    "description": "<blockquote><p>Embodiments of Minor Enlightenment, Manifestations of the Wind, Arrows of Harmony, Born from the Watchtowers.</p></blockquote><p>Tigpana translates directly to <em>bowman.</em> This is the discipline of long distance combat atop bamboo watchtowers, treehouses and rocky outcroppings peppered across The Sword Isles. Disciples are trained to become hiyang with <strong>air</strong>, known as <strong>Nihawa</strong> in Apumbukid, <strong>Diwa</strong> elsewhere, so that they become <strong>one with the battlefield</strong>, harmony with violence.</p><p>This discipline actually originated in Ibalnong, in the northwestern tip of Rusunuga, bordered by the volcano Magayon, the most beautiful volcano in all of The Sword Isles, known for its perfect cone shape. Apumbukid wielded it as violence intensified. Tigpana are masters of all ranged bows: from the common <strong>busog</strong>, or shortbow, to the rarer <strong>sikarom</strong>, the bamboo longbow, which is so long that it had to be held under the foot to be strung.</p><p>The Ibalnongnon are closer to the Gatusanon than the Virbanwans in culture, and also tattooed themselves and raided the coasts of foreign lands. These Ibalnongnon warriors have since taught warriors far and wide the discipline of longbow archery, and have thus produced a new breed of Tigpana across the isles.</p><p>They measure the lay of the wind, the rustle of leaves, the whisper of the land. What heat might do to the trajectory of a fire-hardened arrow, the nuisance of rain. To become a Tigpana is to become one with nature, to be as silent as the first light of dawn, to be as quick as the darkest point in the night.</p><p>Tigpana are made to watch with eyes sharper than eagles. With escalating tensions between polities, these elite sharpshooters have descended down from upon their lofty bamboo watchtowers to fight alongside their fellow Kadungganan. This has done nothing to impede their skill, of course. In fact, all it has done is to show how much more formidable a Tigpana is up close, with perfectly lined shots that can sever the head from the neck.</p><p>The Art of the Tigpana was once preserved only for hunting large game in the forest. It has now been turned into a hateful art that skewers their fellow men. But even then, before going out of a hunt-whether it be for an animal or for a human-Tigpana make their offerings to their gods. In supplication, in sorrow, in a Fulmination of asking forgiveness.</p><p>The Art of Petal Piercing combines Harmony Through Breathing with Archery techniques. To never miss attacks, Tigpana become one with the battlefield, gaining for a moment a violent Hiyang, which they use to be able to be the most accurate martial artists across the Sword Isles. Tigpana are the most powerful snipers, and truly great Tigpana are rare across the Sword Isles.</p><p>If you choose to become a Tigpana ask yourself why you have chosen the path of more violence, if you could've stayed protecting what is yours instead.</p><blockquote><p>Who do you fight for? Why? Blood stains your bowstrings, how long until it flows from your heart?</p></blockquote><p><strong>Weapons:</strong> Longbows, shortbows, minasbad, daggers, knives</p><p><strong>Armors:</strong> War jackets, vests, padded shirts, sarongs, natural mantles</p>",
