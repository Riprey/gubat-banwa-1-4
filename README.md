# Foundry Virtual Tabletop - Gubat Banwa 1.41

This game system for [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](http://foundryvtt.com/) provides character sheets and other features to facilitate online play of **Version 1.4** of [Sword Isles Studios' **Gubat Banwa**](https://gubat-banwa.itch.io/) TTRPG.

## FAQ

**Q:** Is this the latest version of Gubat Banwa?

**A:** No. This is for **Version 1.4** of Gubat Banwa. This is **NOT** compatible with the latest version of Gubat Banwa (Currently 1.71).

**Q:** What? Why did you make a system for an older version of the game?

**A:** The Gubat Banwa project has changed dramatically between each minor release, with gameplay mechanics being completely redone. The current release is still set to change as its recent [Kickstarter Campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/863660422/gubat-banwa) suggests. I mostly made this for my friends, who discovered the system at Version 1.4.

**Q:** Do you know where there's a FoundryVTT system for the latest version of the game?

**A:** Unfortunately no. There is only Drentalbot's [officially submitted Gubat Banwa system](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/gubat-banwa), which is on Version 1.3. Hopefully once the game stabilises there would be more interest in someone making one. Though feel free to fork this repo as a starting point if you feel like making one yourself.
